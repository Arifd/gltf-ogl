This is a bare bones example of how to parse data out of a GLTF Json and Binary file,
then pass that data to Three.js Geometry Buffer that can then be rendered with mesh/materials.

This example also includes a bare bones example of downloading the files to boot, ArrayBuffers to the rescue.

You'll need to run a webserver to be able to run this example, mainly because chrome does not
allow loading of files if run from the desktop. If you need a webserver, I recommend this free chrome
web app that you can easily get and run from the chrome web store. I use it often for development.

Code is provided by SketchpunkLabs. GLTF parser is free to use as you see fit.
